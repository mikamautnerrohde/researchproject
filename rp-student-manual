# Introduction
This is the student manual for the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* within the master programme *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). While the Research Project Manual covers everything there is to know about the structure of the project and its requirements, this manual zooms in on what that means from the student perspective.

# Size
## Nominal size
Let's start with the size of the projects. *Research Project 1* should be 26 EC and *Research Project 2* can be 36 or 42 EC, depending on the amount of approved Electives you want to place in the curricular section of your Study Plan. The size of the two projects together should be withiin the interval of 62 to 68 EC.

As 1 EC corresponds to 28 hours of work, the size of these projects can also be considered as:

Project size (EC)| Workload (hours) | Fulltime equivalent
:----: | :----:|:----:|
26 |728|17 weeks
36|1008|24 weeks
42|1176|28 weeks

Note the term *fulltime equivalent* here. In the ECTS framework, students are expected to spend 42 hours per week on their study, which is how the above numbers were calculated. Students who combine their project with coursework (as the first-years are wont to do due to obligatory classes) can only work a fraction of this time, which then extends the duration of the project accordingly. For example, a student who works 38 hours per week on *Research Project 1* would have to spend 19 weeks on the project to reach a credit value of 26 EC. As most students start this project in February (starting week 5), this means they should finish halfway June (at the end of week 24).

If your Study Plan has odd-numbered components, the EC size (and hence: the duration of the project) might deviate a bit from the scenario above. For example, courses at the Faculty of Economics and Business often have a size of 5 EC. If you take one of those courses as an Elective, you can change your project size to compensate for the difference. See the programme's TER-B for more details on this.

## Real size
We expect your supervisor and examiner to make a fair assessment of what can be done in the hours that you will spend on your project. This is not easy for them to assess, but even then they are in the best position to do so. That being said, do have a critical look at the planning for the project: people tend to overestimate how much they get done in a given period of time.

If the real size of your project is different from the nominal size, you cannot easily increase the credit count for the project, because otherwise the projects would cannibalize other programme components. You may have very good reasons to extend a project -- perhaps that gives you a unique learning opportunity -- so the programme will not interfere with delays, but we strongly encourage students to wrap up their project within the original time limits.

Under extraordinary circumstances, the Examinations Board can decide to grant you additional credits for *Research Project 1*, but that would then limit the size of *Research Project 2*.

# Goals
## Learning objectives
During the research projects, the student is trained to:

1. Engage in the different phases of research in the field of brain and cognitive sciences (i.e. using and selecting relevant literature, choosing a research design, performing experimental work, analyzing data).
2. Independently perform relevant scientific research method(s) and data analyses.
3. Create a realistic planning for research, within the time limits that are imposed.
4. Report about the project in a manner accordant to the norms and standards of a relevant journal
5. Demonstrate academic presentation skills.
6. Demonstrate a scientific attitude (independence, responsibility, perseverance, initiative, self-assessment, communication) within the work and in relation to the supervisor and colleagues.
7. Reflect on and describe the limitations and implications of the research project.
