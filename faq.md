## Student questions

**What is the difference between an internal assessor, an external assessor and an examiner?**
The internal assessor is the person who will grade your work and who works within the hosting lab. The external assessor is the person who will grade your work and who works outside of the hosting lab. One of them also has the label 'examiner': this examiner is a UvA staff member who ensures quality of learning and assessment. All assessors need to have a PhD.

**I am trying to register my project but I am not sure whether the project is internal or external.**
If you are unsure about whether a project is internal or external, it is best to consider whether you want your assessor or your examiner to grade all components (report, presentation and experimental work). If a project is internal, Datanose assumes the examiner should grade all components. If your project is external, Datanose assumes the assessor should grade all components.
