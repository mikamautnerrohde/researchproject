# Introduction
This is the student manual for the modules *Research Project 1* and *Research Project 2* within the master programme *Brain and Cognitive Sciences* at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). While the Research Project Manual covers everything there is to know about the structure of the project and its requirements, this manual zooms in on what that means from the student perspective.

# Size
## Nominal size
Let's start with the size of the projects. *Research Project 1* should be 26 or 32 EC and *Research Project 2* can be 36 or 42 EC, depending on the amount of approved Electives you want to place in the curricular section of your Study Plan. The size of the two projects together should be within the interval of 62 to 68 EC.

As 1 EC corresponds to 28 hours of work, the size of these projects can also be considered as:

Project size (EC)| Workload (hours) | Fulltime equivalent
:----: | :----:|:----:|
26 |728|17 weeks
36|1008|24 weeks
42|1176|28 weeks

Note the term *fulltime equivalent* here. In the ECTS framework, students are expected to spend 42 hours per week on their study, which is how the above numbers were calculated. Students who combine their project with coursework  can only work a fraction of this time, which then extends the duration of the project accordingly. For example, a student who works 38 hours per week on *Research Project 1* would have to spend 19 weeks on the project to reach a credit value of 26 EC. As most students start this project in February (starting week 5), this means they would finish halfway June (at the end of week 24).

If your Study Plan has odd-numbered components, the EC size (and hence: the duration of the project) might deviate a bit from the scenario above. For example, courses at the Faculty of Economics and Business often have a size of 5 EC. If you take one of those courses as an Elective, you can change your project size to compensate for the difference. See the programme's TER-B for more details on this.

## Real size
We expect your supervisor and examiner to make a fair assessment of what can be done in the hours that you will spend on your project. This is not easy for them to assess, but even then they are in the best position to do so. That being said, do have a critical look at the planning for the project: people tend to overestimate how much they get done in a given period of time.

If the real size of your project is different from the nominal size, you cannot easily increase the credit count for the project, because otherwise the projects would cannibalize other programme components. You may have very good reasons to extend a project -- perhaps that gives you a unique learning opportunity -- so the programme will not interfere with delays, but we strongly encourage students to wrap up their project within the original time limits.

# Goals
## Learning objectives
During the research projects, the student is trained to:

1. Engage in the different phases of research in the field of brain and cognitive sciences (i.e. using and selecting relevant literature, choosing a research design, collecting data, performing experimental work, analyzing data, drawing and discussing conclusions)
2. Demonstrate proficiency with relevant scientific research method(s) and data analyses
3. Assess the limitations and implications of the research project
4. Create a realistic and effective planning for the research project
5. Write a scientific report about the project at an academic level
6. Effectively communicate about the project through an oral presentation
Demonstrate a scientific attitude (independence, responsibility, perseverance, initiative, self-assessment, communication) within the work and in relation to the supervisor and colleagues
7. Reflect on personal growth as a researcher
8. Demonstrate good research practices

Learning objective 1 may not be reached in a single Research Project. For example, you might not be able to perform data collection in your _Research Project 1_. If this happens, you should ensure that you do train this in _Research Project 2_. Section 1.1. of your project proposal will ask you to indicate which elements of the research process are present in your specific project.

## Responsibilities
During the first semester of the first year, you may have experienced that you are increasingly expected to take the reins of your own learning process. This is even more pronounced in  _Research Project 1_: it is your project and often it will be up to you to decide on the steps that are necessary to make the project a success. Of course you're not left by yourself and your supervisor should help you if you get stuck or are unsure about something. However, it is important to realize that you are expected to first see if you can understand or figure out something on the basis of the skills and knowledge you already have. That way, the attention of your supervisor can be dedicated to those things you could not reasonably have solved yourself.

## Scope of the project
In principle, the idea of both _Research Project 1_ and _Research Project 2_ is that you pose a research question and do the work to provide an answer to that research question. This limits the types of questions and approaches you could reasonably pursue -- the scope of a 26 EC (4.5 month) project is going to be much, much smaller than that of a 42 EC (7 month) project or full doctoral programme. It is important to set yourself on a mission that both you and your supervisor believe is attainable.

Still, as research is an unpredictable beast, you might find that despite your best efforts and meticulous planning, you did not provide an answer to your research questions. This can be disappointing, but it is just something that happens. You can still write a report and give a presentation and your internal assessor will still be able to evaluate your experimental work.
