# Frequently asked questions

## Student questions

### Project registration

#### What is the difference between an internal assessor, an external assessor and an examiner?
The internal assessor is the person who will grade your work and who works within the hosting lab. The external assessor is the person who will grade your work and who works outside of the hosting lab. One of them also has the label 'examiner': this examiner is a UvA staff member who ensures quality of learning and assessment. All assessors need to have a PhD.

#### I am trying to register my project but I am not sure whether the project is internal or external.
If you are unsure about whether a project is internal or external, it is best to consider whether you want your assessor or your examiner to grade all components (report, presentation and experimental work). If a project is internal, Datanose assumes the examiner should grade all components. If your project is external, Datanose assumes the assessor should grade all components.

#### I want to register my project, but do not have a proposal yet that I can submit. What should I do?
This is fine. Registration is the first step. It just lets you detail where and with whom you will do your internship. After registration, you can submit your research proposal and you have a month to do so. Please note that once you submit your proposal, you cannot register your project with a starting date that is more than 30 days before the proposal submission!

#### How do I fill in who is examiner and who is assessor on Datanose?
Every Research Project involves two distinct assessors. One of these is the examiner, who should be a senior researcher at the UvA. Datanose wants to see explicitly which of the assessors takes on this role. It is important to consider the following.

* If a project is *internal* (at UvA), the examiner will be assessing all elements (experimental work, presentation and report). Choose the person who has agreed to this, so a senior researcher at the institute where you are working.
* If a project is *external* (to UvA), the examiner will only be the second reader of the final report, who is based at UvA. Please select the person who has agreed to this role.
* Fill in the examiner first.
* In the assessor field, fill in the name of the other assessor. If this assessor is not from UvA, you may need to click the blue box labeled "Not in list" in the dialog that pops up when you enter the name of the assessor.

#### My intended examiner is not listed on Datanose
Only the examiners approved by the Examinations Board are listed on Datanose. If you wish to propose a new examiner, please send the name, title and e-mail address of this examiner to info-mcs@uva.nl. Our offices will then request listing of your intended examiner.

#### My intended supervisor or assessor are not listed
When searching for a name, the Datanose dialog also offers you the button 'Not in List'. If you click this button, you can submit details on supervisor and/or assessor manually.

#### I am registering my project on Datanose, but step 2 is missing. Is something wrong?
This is an oddity of the Datanose system. MBCS skips a step that many other educational programmes use during internships, and for some reason our steps cannot be renumbered. You can safely ignore the missing number 2.

## Assessor questions

#### The grading rubric handed to me via the manual is different from the rubrics shown on Datanose. Which one should I use?
Sometimes the grading rubrics tied to a specific project on www.datanose.nl lag behind the rubrics as they were set out in the Research Project Manual. If this is the case, please use the rubrics in the manual to determine the grades per dimension and for the rubrics overall. You can then fill in these grades on Datanose. In the dropdown menu, select the description that is closest to the student performance.

#### I am an examiner and I cannot reach consensus with the assessor about the grading for the research project report. What should I do?
You can contact the programme via info-mcs@uva.nl and send us your considerations. There will be then an additional internal assessment of the work submitted by the student, to arrive at a third opinion. On the basis of this opinion, you can choose to modify your grade or to let it stand: the final grade is then decided by you, as formal examiner of the project.
