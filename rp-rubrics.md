# Introduction
These are the rubrics used to assess _Research Project 1_ and _Research Project 2_. There are two things worth emphasizing about these rubrics:

1. The weights of the aspects within each individual rubric are not predefined.
2. The normative descriptions are abstracted and might require reinterpration for any given project.

Both these points can be explained by the diverse range of projects that are performed by students from the research master Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Different disciplines will place different requirements on student performance.

# Rubrics
There are three rubrics, corresponding to the three graded components: experimental work, written report and oral presention.

## Experimental work
Experimental work counts towards 40% of the final mark and can only be assessed by the internal assessor of the project.

|Aspect|Poor (<4)|Not sufficient (4-5)|Sufficient (6)|Good (7-8)|Excellent (9-10)|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Collecting literature|The student did not manage to collect and evaluate appropriate literature in time, leading to an incomplete understanding of the context of the project. This hampered performance on the project as a whole.|The student collected relevant literature, but did not arrive at a demonstrable, full understanding of the theory that was relevant to this project. This prevented the student from fully motivating all the important choices relevant to the research question and experimental design.	|The student collected and evaluated relevant literature, leading to a good understanding of the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the project took place. The student can motivate the choice of research questions and important design choices.	|The student collected literature that was relevant for the research project, critically assessed this literature and obtained a strong overview of both the theoretical framework and empirical space in which the research project took place. The student can clearly argue what the value of the research question under consideration is, and can motivate all steps in the experimental design. Moreover, the student is capable of comparing the approach taken within the project with those in peer-reviewed literature.|The student gained a full understanding of the theoretical framework in which the research project was situated, and was able to critically evaluate the existing literature. The student demonstrably gained valuable insights this way and managed to translate them into practice, whether through research design, analysis or discussion.|
|Experimental skills|Experimental work done by the student is not efficient, either because of low accuracy, low speed or the requirement of intensive supervision.|The student learned to employ the techniques that were necessary to gather data, but there is considerate room for improvement with regards to timeliness or accuracy or the student lacks sufficient understanding of the principles behind the techniques.|The student worked in a timely and accurate fashion when applying the techniques relevant to this project. The student has a good idea of how the techniques work and what their principles are, but is not yet able to apply them independently or in a novel setting.|The student mastered the techniques that were necessary to gather data and understands their principles and their scope of applicability. The student works timely and accurately when doing such experimental work.|The student mastered the techniques that were necessary to gather data and understands their principles and their scope of applicability.

|Data Analysis|The student is not yet able to select a data analysis method and/or cannot analyze and interpret results without step-by-step supervision.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project and is also able to analyze and interpret the results, but still requires considerable supervision to do so, and is not capable of motivating important choices during the analysis.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project. The student has shown a good understanding of the workings of the analysis methods and is able to analyze and interpret results independently.|The student is able to select appropriate data analysis methods for acquired data in the domain of the research project, and can provide clear argumentation to support a choice. The student is able to perform analysis and interpret the results critically, while relatively unsupervised.|The student is able to find and choose methods of analysis that fit with the acquired data and the research questions under consideration. The student can clearly argue for a chosen approach and can independently find or develop new ways to analyze data. The student displays a critical attitude when evaluating the results of analyses and performs well, even if unsupervised.|
|Process|The learning process of the student was unnecessarily hindered for a long time and/or the student could not be relied upon when agreements or deadlines were set. Feedback had little effect to improve the learning of the student.|The student stayed in control of the learning process, seeking out information independently or by asking questions. However, the learning process was unnecessarily hindered at times and/or the student had difficulties upholding agreements and deadlines.|The student showed initiative in learning, seeking out information independently or by asking questions. The student responded well to feedback and upheld agreements and deadlines.|The student has demonstrated to be inquisitive during the learning process, keeping the right balance between asking questions and learning independently. The student upheld agreements and deadlines, responded well to feedback and took initiative to structure the internship, set personal goals and optimize learning.|The student has demonstrated to be inquisitive during the learning process, keeping the right balance between asking questions and learning independently. The student upheld agreements and deadlines, responded well to feedback and took initiative to structure the internship, set personal goals and optimize learning. Throughout the project, the student remained self-directed and goal-oriented, critically evaluating progress and adapting to optimize the outcomes of the project.|
|Original contribution|Throughout the project, the student mostly followed instructions with regards to experimental design, data analysis and interpretation. The student did not bring in any substantial ideas for the project.|The student demonstrated the ability to make choices for the experimental design, data analysis and interpretation of results, but only when prompted by the supervisor.|The student demonstrated the ability to formulate good hypotheses and make design choices independently, in collaboration with the supervisor.|The student can formulate good hypotheses and make design choices independently, and can articulate (good) reasoning behind those choices. The student came up with original insights or ideas that clearly aided data collection, analysis or interpretation.|The student took full ownership of the project and added original, valuable ideas to each stage that the project went through. The student has demonstrated to to be creative while employing scientific rigor and successfully shaped the project.|

## Written work

# Using the rubrics
To assess work using the rubrics, first determine how much weight you'd give each aspect in the respective rubric. Once you have determined this, pick the normative descriptions that best describe the level of the work for each aspect. When doing so, you will end up in a specific column for each aspect, which corresponds to a bandwidth of grades. You have discretion to choose the lower bound, the upper bound or somewhere else within this bandwidth.

Once you have determined all the grades, you can use the weights of the aspects to arrive at a partial marks per rubric. These partial marks per rubric are then averaged according to preset weights, to arrive at a final mark: 50% written work, 40% experimental work and 10% presentation.

You can fill in the rubrics on the Datanose project page of the Research Project, once the time to assess has come (i.e. once the student has submitted the report).
